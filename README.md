This mod improves some aspects of vanilla chests!

Special Thanks to:

## Changes:
### More Sorting Options
Right clicking on "Sort Items" in a chest or right clicking "Sort Inventory" will open a menu with more sort options.

### Multiplayer Chests
Multiple players can use a chest at the same time now! (might still have some bugs, it's the hardest feature to test)

### Ownership
You can claim chest ownership. This prevents other players from opening or quick stacking into chests which you own.

### Longer Chest Names
Increased the maximum chest name length from 20 to 80. You can finally write longer chest names!
