[h3]Multiplayer Chests[/h3]
Multiple players can use a chest at the same time now! (might still have some bugs, it's the hardest feature to test)

[h3]Ownership[/h3]
You can claim chest ownership. This prevents other players from opening or quick stacking into chests which you own.

[h3]Longer Chest Names[/h3]
Increased the maximum chest name length from 20 to 80. You can finally write longer chest names!
